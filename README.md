Memory
======

A responsive JavaScript game - http://jamiekdonnelly.github.io/Memory/

###About
This is my first attempt at building a web app. I built the game due to the logic involved in the code, which I figured would help me learn more! Expect the script to be clunky and poorly structured, nevertheless I had a lot of fun building it and hope that it may come of use to somebody!  


###Setup
To get stuck into the code, you'll need to rub Grunt.
  * Clone the project
  * Open your command line
  * Run `npm install -g grunt-cli`
  * `cd` into the root of project
  * Run `npm install`
  * Run Grunt with `grunt`.

###Bugs and To-Do's!
  - Currently not working in IE due to CSS3 preserve 3D 
  - Images load immensly slow, need preloading.
  - Script could probably be tidier!
