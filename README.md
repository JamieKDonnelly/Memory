Memory
======

A responsive JavaScript game - http://jamiekdonnelly.github.io/Memory/

###About
This is my first attempt at building a web app. I built the game due to the logic involved in the code, which I figured would help me learn more! Expect the script to be clunky and poorly structured, nevertheless I had a lot of fun building it and hope that it may come of use to somebody!  


###Setup
`cd` into root project file with command line, run `grunt`. For more information on how to use Grunt, go to http://gruntjs.com/getting-started

###Bugs/Issues
  - Currently not working in IE due to 3D 
  - Images need preloading 
  - Script could be tidier!
